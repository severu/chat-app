# chat-app
A basic chat app that uses socket io to do real-time updates.
I recommend using VS code for this project

- [ ] Go to project's directory
- [ ] Open VS code -- command is "code ." via bash
- [ ] Install dependencies if needed.
- [ ] Open new terminal in VS code
- [ ] Change directory to client folder
- [ ] Input command: "npm start" to start the client at port 3000
        [] The browser should open it automatically
- [ ] Open another terminal
- [ ] Change directory to server folder
- [ ] Input command: "npm run dev" to start the server
